    <span>Hello Everyone! 
      So this is our Project in the Static Webpage Designing.  <br>
      In this project we have used HTML, CSS, and a little part of the JavaScript. <br>
      So this webpage provides you with the various recipies of the meals. <br>
       It is just the basic layout so it is not yet fully functional webpage.  <br>
       It just comes up with the page template and has only the FrontEnd part.
